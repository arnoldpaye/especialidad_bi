# Data Mining for Software Engineering

Software Engineering data can be categorized into:

- _sequences_: execution traces, static traces, co-changed.
- _graphs_: dynamic call graphs, static call graphs.
- _text_: bug reports, e-mails, code comments, documentation.

## Mining sequences

SE sequence data include method-call sequences:
- dynamically collected during program execution
- statically extracted from program source code

New algorithms developed: mining iterative patterns, temporal rules,
sequence diagrams, finit-state machines and sequence association rules.
